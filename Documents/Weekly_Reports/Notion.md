# Notion for project management

## Overview

**This will be a short document to explain the main tool used to manage**.We mainly used Notion to track our progress and the advancement of the project, it has been separated in different sections containing a brainstorming section, a section were the tasks are assigned, the projects section were we assigned our objectives and finally a resources page that contains from help on assembly to a rough plan for the code.

## Brainstorming

The Brainstorming section was mainly used at the beginning of the project to find our desired solution and what we wanted to do for the game but it was also used for the functional specifications, and the different documents we needed to do.
