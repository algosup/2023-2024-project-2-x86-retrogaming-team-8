# Weekly Report 2 (Monday 13th-Friday 17th): Assembly Project Progress

## Overview

The focus for this week was primarily on the advancement of the game. We have started creating it following the assembly classes we went through, which were helpful in understanding the language at a deeper level. This created a smoother game development process. Additionally, significant progress has been made on the Test-plan, with the initial creation phase completed.

## Technical Achievements

1. **Learning development:** The process of learning the Assembly language is progressing smoothly, thanks to the courses we've had and the knowledge-sharing sessions we have done as a team. The practical application of assembly language concepts learned in the classes is proving beneficial in the coding process as we have managed to display a ghost.
