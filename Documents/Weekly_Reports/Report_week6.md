# Weekly Report 6 (Monday 11th-Friday 15th): Assembly Project Progress

## Overview

The focus for this week was mainly on the collisions for the game. We have managed to do the detections of the collisions the work has been mainly on detecting the color of the pixel. We are now working on the function to stop pac-man using the detection.

## Technical Achievements

1. **Game Development:** We have advanced on the collisions, more than half of it is now implemented, what we now require is to link the detection with the movement of Pac-man so that he cannot eat the walls.

2. **Functional development:** The Program manager has finished polishing the functional specifications they are now more in scope towards what we actually have and they are also more detailed.

2. **Delegation of Project manager:** The project manager (David Cuahonte) will be absent for the last week of project, because of that the team decided to delegate the manager role to the program manager (Atifa Amiri) for the last week.
