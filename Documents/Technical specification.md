## 1. Introduction
â€‹
### Overview, Problem Description, Summary, or Abstract
â€‹
Summary of the problem (from the perspective of the user), the context, suggested solution, and the stakeholders.
â€‹
### Glossary or Terminology
â€‹
New terms you come across as you research your design or terms you may suspect your readers/stakeholders not to know.
â€‹
### Functional and Technical Requirements
â€‹
- Functional requirements in the form of user stories (or links to the functional specification)
- Technical requirements
â€‹
### Non-Goals or Out of Scope
â€‹
Functional and technical requirements that will be disregarded
â€‹
### Future Goals
â€‹
Functional and technical requirements slated for a future time
â€‹
### Assumptions
â€‹
Conditions and resources that need to be present and accessible for the solution to work as described.
â€‹
## 2. Solutions
â€‹
### Suggested or Proposed Solution / Design
â€‹
- External components that the solution will interact with and that it will alter
- Dependencies of the current solution
- Pros and cons of the proposed solution
â€‹
#### Data Model / Schema Changes
â€‹
- Schema definitions
- New data models
- Modified data models
- Data validation methods
â€‹
#### Business Logic
â€‹
- Public APIs
- Complex or interesting algorithms (consider include pseudocode)
- Error states
- Failure scenarios
- Conditions that lead to errors and failures
- Limitations
â€‹
#### Presentation Layer
â€‹
- Wireframes with descriptions
- Links to UI/UX designerâ€™s work
- Mobile concerns
- Web concerns
- UI states
- Error handling
â€‹
#### Other questions to answer
â€‹
- How will the solution scale?
- What are the limitations of the solution?
- How will it recover in the event of a failure?
- How will it cope with future requirements?
â€‹
### Test Plan
â€‹
- Explanations of how the tests will make sure user requirements are met
- Unit tests
- Integrations tests
- Performance & Reliability tests
â€‹
### Monitoring and Alerting Plan
â€‹
- Logging plan and tools
- Monitoring plan and tools
- Metrics to be used to measure health
- How to ensure observability
- Alerting plan and tools
â€‹
### Release / Roll-out and Deployment Plan
â€‹
- Deployment architecture
- Deployment environments
- Phased roll-out plan e.g. using feature flags
- Plan outlining how to communicate changes to the users, for example, with release notes
â€‹
### Alternate Solutions / Designs
â€‹
- Short summary statement for each alternative solution
- Pros and cons for each alternative
- Reasons why each solution was not selected
- Ways in which alternatives were inferior to the proposed solution
- Migration plan to next best alternative in case the proposed solution falls through
â€‹
## 3. Further Considerations
â€‹
### Third-party services and platforms considerations
â€‹
- Is it really worth it compared to building the service in-house?
- What are some of the security and privacy concerns associated with the services/platforms?
- How much will it cost?
- How will it scale?
- What possible future issues are anticipated?
â€‹
### Security considerations
â€‹
- What are the potential threats?
- How will they be mitigated?
- How will the solution affect the security of other components, services, and systems?
â€‹
### Risks
â€‹
- What risks exist with this solution?
- Are there risks that once taken canâ€™t be walked back?
- What is the cost-benefit analysis of taking these risks?
