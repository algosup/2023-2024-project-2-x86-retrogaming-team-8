Then the player need to eat every little cubes without be touched by the ghosts to have an access to the next level.

- B. Enhance randomness and scores system

#### 4. Personas & Use Case
- Our main target are the retrogamers from any gender, giving them a fresh air of an old game and adding some new mechanics while maintaining the old design.

#### 8. Interfaces

- Layout, maze, Pac-Man, ghosts, HUD.
    - We can reorganize the HUD to gather in one place bonus, lives and score.
- Menus, settings, controls.
    - For this game, we must implement a start screen with a choice of the levels and some parameters like ‚Äúmute the sound effect‚Äù. During the game we need a ‚Äúmenu‚Äù control to have a pause functionality and a way to reset the game.
